# Simple-programs-in-C
A collection of functions that manipulate elements and uses computational and mathematical applications to find meaningful insights within data.

Projects:
1. Given a number and return the number in reverse order.
2. Given 2 angles of a triangle, check if a triangle is Right, Isosceles, or both.
3. Given the 3 edge lengths of a triangle, check if a triangle is Right.
4. Given an index, return the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence.
5. Given a positive long integer, check if it is a prime number.
6. Given a non-negative float number, return its square root (without using any library functions).
7.Given an array of integers, the number of items, and an integer value (the element), find the first index at which the given element is found in the array.
8. Given an array of integers and the size of array, calculate the rounded average of the numbers.
9. Given an array of integers, the size of array, and the size of the segment, move the initial segment of the array to the end and shift all the remaining elements to the left.
10. Given a char pointer, find and return the length of the string pointed to by the pointer.
11. Given 2 char pointers, compare the strings pointed to by the pointers lexicographically (case sensitive).
12. Given a char pointer to a string, convert the string to an integer using ASCII code.
13. Given 2 points on a coordinate plane, find the (float) distance between the 2 points.
14. Given 2 const pointers to struct Person type variables, compare the variable's ID numbers using the indirect member access operator (â†’).
