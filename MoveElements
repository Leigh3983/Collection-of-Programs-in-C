# Given an array of integers, the size of the array, and the size of a segment in the array, the function moves the initial segment of consecutive array elements to the end of the array. 
# The elements that follow the segment are all moved to the left. The elements in the are moved in place.
# The function does not use an auxiliary array, but rather only uses a single temporary int variable.
# For example: Given the array 3, 7, 2, 8, 5, 9, 1, 4: The result of moving the initial segment that includes 3 elements (i.e., [3, 7, 2]) is 8, 5, 9, 1, 4, 3, 7, 2.
